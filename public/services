        "description": "Sometimes, it is necessary to use invasive scans when checking for vulnerabilities such as stored or persistent XSS attacks, where junk input is injected into a web application. In a stored XSS attack, an application is vulnerable if it does not validate the input before storing and embedding it. A garbage input is then stored and served to users automatically when they visit your web page. When a website vulnerability scanner uses an invasive technique to scan for this issue, it may pose the risk of running this issue on the website forever and exposing it to the attackers.!",

Securing cloud services begins with understanding what exactly is being secured, as well as, the system aspects that must be managed.As an overview, backend development against security vulnerabilities is largely within the hands of cloud service providers. Aside from choosing a security-conscious provider, clients must focus mostly on proper service configuration and safe use habits. Additionally, clients should be sure that any end-user hardware and networks are properly secured.!",

Data Protection as a Service (DPaaS) plays a core function in business today, and here’s the reason: since all organizations use information in numerous structures, protecting data is a main concern for each company. However, not all organizations can bear to invest in a skilled and resourceful IT team. Thus, Data Protection as a Service (DPaaS) bodes well both financially and technically. Pushing this pattern: the increasing migration of traditional databases and services to the cloud in the midst of heightening cybersecurity threats.!",

There are various kinds of application security programs, services, and devices an organization can use. Firewalls, antivirus systems, and data encryption are just a few examples to prevent unauthorized users from entering a system. If an organization wishes to predict specific, sensitive data sets, they can establish unique application security policies for those resources.Application security can occur in various stages, but establishing best practices happens most often in the application development phases.!",

It focuses on the assets that the organization needs to protect the most. Threat hunting is not penetration testing, security monitoring, or incident response, but it can include aspects of those activities.The goal of threat hunting is to convert operational challenges into strengths. It is a force-multiplier, occupying the space between threat intelligence, security operations, and incident response. A common saying in incident response is. Secure works offers annual managed and point-in-time threat hunting services that help organizations who are just getting started or need a long-term partner. After collaborating with customers to understand their environment, we focus on identifying unknown and novel compromise activity so customers can concentrate on fortifying their environments and responding to known incidents.",
